# Online-Shopping
Online Shopping is the process of purchasing goods or services over the internet using websites, mobile apps, or other digital platforms. Instead of visiting physical stores, customers can browse a wide variety of products online, compare prices, read reviews, and place orders from the comfort of their homes. I did this project using HTML and CSS.
